          <p>
            <translate>
              In no event will HRP or its directors, employees, or agents be
              liable to you or any third person for any direct, indirect,
              consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive
              damages, including for any lost profits or lost data arising from
              your use of the Website or this service or the unavailability of
              the Website or this service. When using the Website, information
              will be transmitted over a medium that may be beyond the control
              and jurisdiction of HRP. Accordingly, HRP assumes no liability for
              or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption of
              any data or other information transmitted in connection with use
              of the Website.

          <h4><translate>Terminations</translate></h4>
          <p>
            <translate>
              At any time and without notice, we may suspend, cancel, or
              terminate your right to use this Website or any portion of the
              Website. In the event of a suspension, cancellation, or
              termination, you are no longer authorized to access the part of
              the Website affected by such suspension, cancellation, or
              termination.

          <h4><translate>Other Terms</translate></h4>
          <p>
            <translate>
              These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and HRP
              regarding the use of the Website and supersede any prior
              agreements between you and HRP relating to your use of the
              Website. The failure of HRP to exercise or enforce any right or
              provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
              right or provision in that or any other instance. If any provision
              of these Terms is held invalid, the remainder of the Terms shall
              continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms
              shall be deemed unlawful, void, or for any other reason
              unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from
              these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
              of any remaining provisions. This agreement shall be governed and
              construed by the laws of the District of Columbia without giving
              effect to any principles of conflicts of law. The foregoing
              provisions of these Terms are for the benefit of HRP, its
              affiliates, and third-party content providers and licensors, and
              each shall have the right to asset and enforce provisions of the
              Terms directly and on their own behalf.
