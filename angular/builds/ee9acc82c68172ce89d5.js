First, procedures must be established to address <b><em>technical constraints</em></b> related to connectivity and electricity (see Axis 1: Groundwork), for users to operate the application during network shortages, power outages or other unforeseen issues. In addition, promoting the <b><em>retention of devices</em></b> requires strategic planning and the adoption of procedures to prevent loss, theft, breakage and the misuse of mobile devices.
