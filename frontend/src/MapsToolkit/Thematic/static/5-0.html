<blockquote>
    <h6>End-users</h6>
    <p>Health workers or other clients who interact directly with the technology.</p>
    <h6>Secondary users</h6>
    <p>Individuals who derive benefit
from end-usersâ€™ input into mHealth products, but do not themselves directly enter data (e.g. supervisors).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Project teams must be careful not to underestimate the human resources required to successfully scale up and sustain mHealth products. Accurate projections are needed to determine the appropriate increases in staff numbers and capacities. Human resource investments including recruitment and capacity-building should involve general project staff, staff working directly with the mHealth product and staff in partner organizations. To meet changing needs, <b><em>workforce development</em></b> calls for strategic planning to increase personnel capacity, redefine roles and responsibilities, and implement new staff policies to align with anticipated changes in workflow. In addition to recruiting new staff, project teams should consider staff retention and knowledge management. Opportunities for promotion, benefits and incentive schemes will help build a stable team with the required training, experience and collective goals.</p>

<p>Another central consideration related to personnel involves defining the main <b><em>leadership</em></b> roles that will support operations as they scale up. In addition to having appropriate expertise, leaders need to possess authority and credibility with core partners.25 Key leadership positions reflect the evolving needs of a project and generally include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>a director or advisor to provide strategic oversight</li>
    <li>a manager to support organizational and personnel needs</li>
    <li>a systems administrator to manage the technology</li>
    <li>a financial manager to assess financial requirements, and track expenditures, profits and losses.</li>
</ul>
