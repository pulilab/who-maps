<p><translate>The first step to managing a projectâ€™s financial health is to understand the costs of operating at the current level of implementation, and then to forecast future costs. Project teams must consider the costs of the mHealth product from a programme perspective, a user perspective and a health system perspective in order to fully capture the costs that will be associated with scaling up.</translate></p>

<p><translate>In terms of <b><em>programme cost</em></b>, strong financial management entails the ability to track expenditures, categorize costs and estimate how costs during scaling up will vary from pilot phase costs. The project team should differentiate between <b>recurring fixed costs</b>, <b>variable costs</b> and one-time <b>capital costs</b>, and create a budget that reflects these categories. Furthermore, projects should attempt to quantify any in-kind contributions they may receive from other organizations, and identify cost-share opportunities (i.e. differentiating between costs that will be covered by the project team itself and costs that may be covered by other stakeholders). Project teams should also keep in mind that drafting a budget should not be a one-off event. Budgets should be revisited regularly since funding, assumptions and activities can all change. Regular review will assist project teams to plan appropriately for increasing their scale and managing resources efficiently.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Next, the project team must consider <b><em>end-user cost</em></b>, or the cost incurred by the user, which includes technology costs (e.g. mobile devices, airtime) and non-technology costs (e.g. costs associated with seeking services promoted by the mHealth product, or cost savings resulting from receiving information through a mobile device). These end-user costs have implications for the feasibility of scaling up, and calculating them will help project teams anticipate any economic barriers to widespread user adoption.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Finally, from the perspective of <b><em>health system cost</em></b>, it will be important for the project team to collaborate with stakeholders in the health sector. This will help them anticipate changes in the demand for services that may follow when the product is scaled up. Such changes will have a ripple effect and are likely to affect the workload of health workers and additional providers (e.g. clinicians may need more time for additional antenatal care visits) as well as the supplies and commodities required to meet increased demand. By capturing these anticipated changes within the health system and service/care delivery, project teams will build a more precise picture of the costs and benefits of scaling up.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Once the project team has defined these three levels of cost, they may harness this knowledge as the basis for <b><em>forecasting</em></b> the economic costs of scaling up. Forecasting first and foremost requires an analysis of the total cost of ownership (TCO), which estimates the total cost of the product, including raw materials, supplies, labour and other related overheads. Yet forecasting does not simply involve extracting figures from a budget. Instead, it calls for judicious and creative thinking to address several concerns. These include determining the key cost drivers, which are factors that cause programme, end-user or health system costs to change, such as mobile phone penetration and user demand. In addition, project teams must identify where cost savings could be achieved, and think through the assumptions and corresponding risks that could affect projects. Considerations like these will help project teams construct a more realistic view of the costs of scaling up, and prepare them better to avoid financial setbacks that may emerge over time.</translate></p>
