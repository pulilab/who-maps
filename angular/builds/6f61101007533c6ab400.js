Latency, along with bandwidth, determines the speed of a network connection.</translate></p>\n\n<p><b><translate>mHealth strategy:</translate></b><translate> The application of a technology for a defined health purpose (e.g. text message to deliver messages for antenatal care follow-up) in order to address specific health system challenges.</translate></p>\n\n<p><b><translate>Mobile aggregator:</translate></b><translate> A company that serves as an intermediary between application/content providers and MNOs in order to provide message traffic throughput to multiple MNOs or other aggregators. Mobile aggregators also often rent out virtual numbers and short codes to application/content providers, and may provide mobile initiative campaign oversight, administration and billing services.</translate></p>\n\n<p><b><translate>Mobile health (mHealth):</translate></b><translate> The use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives.</translate></p>\n\n<p><b><translate>Mobile money:</translate></b><translate> A cash management service available on a mobile device or the Internet that facilitates money transfer by allowing customers to convert cash to and from electronic value (“e-money”), and perform transfers or make payments.</translate></p>\n\n<p><b><translate>Mobile network operator (MNO):</translate></b><translate> A telephone company that provides wireless communications services for mobile phone subscribers.

For an mHealth product to be sustainable, it must be supported by stable and secure financial and technical resources, as well as enduring partnerships.
