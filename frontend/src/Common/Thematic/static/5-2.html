</div>

<p>In addition to user training, operations will benefit from outreach and sensitization activities with the stakeholder and community groups involved in the scaling-up process. <b><em>Stakeholder outreach</em></b> should engage the staff of implementing organizations (e.g. CBOs and NGOs), as well as government representatives, as appropriate. Furthermore, it is essential that project teams pursue <b><em>community mobilization</em></b> activities to sensitize the communities that will benefit from the services provided by the product. Such activities involve raising awareness of the benefits of the product, familiarizing community members with its purpose and related procedures, and engaging with the community council or other leadership body to obtain any necessary approval for implementing the product.</p>
