<p>We are proud to present this mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale (MAPS) Toolkit to help advance discussions on how to scale up mobile health (mHealth) innovations and maximize their impact on outcomes for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health.</p>

<p>To mobilize global commitment and spur progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon launched the Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health in 2010. The Strategy called all partners to action, resulting in the unprecedented movement Every Woman Every Child (EWEC), which generated hundreds of financial, policy and service delivery commitments from governments, civil society, donors, and the private sector. Innovation was among the key areas highlighted in the Strategy where action was urgently required. The EWEC Innovation Working Group (IWG) has been instrumental in taking this agenda forward, not least by supporting the adoption and scaling up of mHealth solutions that strengthen the availability of essential health interventions that save women and children’s lives.</p>

<p>The ubiquity of mobile technology in low- and middle-income countries has triggered an unprecedented investment in mHealth tools that are designed to enhance clinical decision support, measurement and accountability, and strengthen the coverage and quality of life-saving interventions. Established by the Government of Norway in 2011, the IWG Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism has played an instrumental role in supporting such mHealth innovations. Through a collaboration between the United Nations Foundation and the World Health Organization, the grant mechanism has offered both financial resources and technical assistance to support the scaling up of these innovations across 15 countries.These grantees should be proud of the contributions they have made to building an evidence base, expanding the dynamics of partnerships with both governments and the private sector, and delivering impact.</p>

<p>Over the past four years, this Toolkit has benefited from the insights gathered through these pioneering mHealth projects. The Toolkit harnesses the learnings that the IWG Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism has contributed to scaling up mHealth innovations and maximizing their impact on women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health.</p>

<p>The Toolkit arrives at a critical juncture, coinciding with the launch of the renewed Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s, and Adolescents’ Health. As we transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals, digital innovations will need to play an even greater role in meeting the commitments to improve the well-being of women, children and adolescents globally.</p>
