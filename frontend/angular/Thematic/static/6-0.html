    <h3><translate>Domain 15: Process monitoring</translate></h3>
</div>

<p><translate>The first component of mHealth M&amp;E is the routine monitoring of implementation to track programme processes and address any challenges that emerge during the scaling-up process. This involves monitoring programme fidelity, which requires that adequate resources – both financial and human – are in place from the start. A portion of the project budget should be allocated to these continuous monitoring activities. While the exact amount will vary, donor organizations such as the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) suggest allocating 10% of the project budget to M&amp;E. Next, projects should develop the overall plan for checking process indicators, such as a Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP), to guide ongoing data collection. This plan should define appropriate performance indicators, data sources, instruments, and the methods and schedule for data collection.</translate></p>

<p><translate>After determining the most appropriate way to collect monitoring data, the project team should determine the specific procedures and tools that will be used for analysing the data in order to identify implementation-related challenges. This process monitoring data will contribute to the optimization of the scaling-up process because it will provide information that can be used as a basis for making adjustments and course corrections.</translate></p>

<p><translate>A process of continuous quality improvement can be fostered by the inclusion of user-friendly dashboards and scorecards to benchmark progress and indicate where to implement relevant course-correction procedures. In addition, explicit structures must be defined for the collection of user feedback and for addressing implementation-related challenges.</translate></p>
