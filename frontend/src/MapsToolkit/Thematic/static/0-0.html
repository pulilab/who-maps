  <h6>Scaling up</h6>
  <p>Scaling up consists of deliberate efforts to increase the impact of innovations successfully tested in pilot or experimental projects so as to benefit more people and to foster policy and programme development on a lasting basis.</p>
  <h6>Sustainability</h6>
  <p>A process that enables individuals, communities and organizations to decrease their dependence on insecure resources and maintain the health gains of the intervention beyond the specific/initial project period. For an mHealth product to be sustainable, it must be supported by stable and secure financial and technical resources, as well as enduring partnerships. In addition, sustainability depends on the project’s capacity to continually adapt the product to meet the demands of users and the ever-evolving operational environment.</p>

<p>Mobile technologies have shown incredible potential for improving our capacity to overcome barriers to the optimal performance of health systems. Since the early 2000s, enthusiasm surrounding the use of mobile digital wireless technologies for health (mHealth) has surged along with the rapid adoption of mobile devices throughout low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Short-term evaluations suggest that the use of mHealth offers opportunities for improving health and health system outcomes. In particular, mHealth is appropriate for addressing many of the health system constraints that currently inhibit services for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) in LMICs, and critical strategies for catalysing the potential for achieving universal health coverage goals.</p>

<p>Recent health interventions incorporating mHealth consist largely of pilot projects or small-scale implementations, many of which have focused on establishing evidence of feasibility and effect, without extensive exploration of the infrastructure needed for <b>scaling up</b> and sustaining the mHealth product. As a result, there is limited understanding of what may be required to translate these projects into larger-scale deployments that can be sustained over the long term.</p>

<p>Growing concern with the number of mHealth products that have failed to become integrated into the national health system or to achieve <b>sustainability</b> has triggered research on barriers to scale. The current literature surrounding scaling up mHealth offers many recommendations for addressing identified challenges, yet these are weighted heavily towards broad, systems-level changes. These publications emphasize issues beyond the immediate control of a project, operating at the ecosystem level, such as the creation of robust data standards, national electronic health (eHealth) policies, and the adoption of mHealth by ministries of health. While important, such recommendations may not be readily actionable from the perspective of mHealth project teams.</p>

  <h6>Endgame</h6>
  <p>A project’s long-term approach to scaling up and sustaining the mHealth product once it has proven the effectiveness of its core strategy and technology.5, 6 An mHealth product may pursue sustainability through the following endgame strategies:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>&rarr; Government adoption</strong><br>
    A model with potential for high coverage and seeking integration into public sector programmes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&rarr; Commercial adoption</strong><br>
    A model with potential for profit and seeking to be delivered through the private sector.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&rarr; Hybrid</strong><br>
    Models that entail elements of both the public and private sectors also exist.
  </p>
  <p><small>Note: Government adoption, commercial adoption, and hybrid models are discussed in greater detail under Axis 1.</small></p>

<p>In response to this need, the <b>mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale (MAPS) Toolkit</b> was designed to help project teams conduct self-assessments, review progress and develop plans to improve their ability to scale up and achieve sustainability of their mHealth products. Uniquely, the MAPS Toolkit emphasizes that scaling up is a dynamic process and that projects will need to be responsive to the changing circumstances defining health systems in LMICs.19 In this Toolkit, there is no discrete marker or threshold numbers for achieving scale. To this end, the MAPS Toolkit approaches scaling up as a continuous process and offers insights that will prove useful throughout the ongoing stages of mHealth project goals for scaling up and sustainability, whether projects are focused on government adoption, commercial adoption, or a hybrid model.</p>
