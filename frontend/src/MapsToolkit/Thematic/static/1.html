    <p>Before initiating the complex process of scaling up, a project must have a solid foundation, including scope, goals and basis of need. Axis 1: Groundwork describes three domains that need to be addressed before a project should move through the next axes. These cover: (a) the scaling-up goals and endgame, (b) the contextual environment of the target setting, and (c) the underlying scientific basis for the mHealth product itself. Describing these domains will lay the groundwork for subsequent strategic planning decisions along the entire scaling-up pathway.</p>
