    <h3>Domain 8: Data</h3>
</div>

<p>The most basic concern regarding technology is to ensure the mHealth system supports data needs in terms of access, transmission, storage and security, throughout all levels of implementation. <b><em>Data accessibility and quality</em></b> may be enhanced by different features of the mHealth application. These include a robust <b>dashboard</b> and automated data quality assurance measures that assess the data for inconsistencies, errors or missing elements (e.g. validation rules built into the application). Having mechanisms within the system to minimize data errors is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>In addition to improving data quality, project teams can also enhance the capacity of the data centre to support <b><em>data transmission and storage</em></b>. They will need to consider data flow (determined by the latency of the data centre), connectivity and throughput (determined by the bandwidth for data transmission) and storage capacity (determined by features of the data storage system). If the system is able to support all of these features at increasing levels of scale, then it will pass the decisive <b>stress test</b>.</p>

<blockquote class="full-block">
    <div><h6>DATA DASHBOARD</h6>
      <p>A user interface that organizes and presents information and data in a way that is easy to read. User-friendly dashboards facilitate real-time system tracking and decision-making.</p></div>

    <div><h6>DATA DICTIONARY</h6>
      <p>A description about a data set that details features such as meaning, relationships to other data, origin, usage and the format of specific data elements.</p></div>

    <div><h6>DATA PRIVACY</h6>
      <p>The capacity to guarantee that patientsâ€™ personal data will be protected against intentional and unintentional exposure.</p></div>

    <div><h6>DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE</h6>
      <p>Mechanisms for evaluating data within the mHealth system for inconsistencies, errors or missing elements.</p></div>

    <div><h6>LATENCY</h6>
      <p>The amount of time or delay for data to travel from the source (mobile device) to the data centre. Latency, along with bandwidth, determines the speed of a network connection.</p></div>

    <div><h6>STRESS TEST</h6>
      <p>An assessment of how well the entire mHealth system functions when tested by extreme conditions (e.g. maximum data requests).</p></div>

    <div><h6>ARCHITECTURE</h6>
      <p>A description of how the different pieces of a technology and/or information system work together.</p></div>

<p>Lastly, robust <b><em>data security</em></b> is a key element of an effective mHealth system, and may be facilitated through both hardware- and software-based mechanisms. <b>Data privacy</b> (a related concept) is also required to enforce measures to protect client data against being exposed accidentally or accessed by unauthorized individuals. Since patient privacy is an important legal issue, the product must adhere to any related national policies. This may have implications for data collection and processing within the mHealth product.</p>
