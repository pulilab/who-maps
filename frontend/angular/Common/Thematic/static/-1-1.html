<p><translate>WHO would like to gratefully acknowledge all the mHealth project teams, experts, thought leaders and other partners who shared their insights, perspectives and rich experiences throughout the process of developing this Toolkit. The meaningful contributions of such a diverse group of actors from the mobile health (mHealth) space have been essential to the success of this project. The Toolkit has been largely informed by the scaling-up challenges and lessons learnt that have emerged from the United Nations Innovation Working Group (IWG) Catalytic mHealth Grant Mechanism, in support of the Every Woman Every Child global strategy. This mechanism, which consists of a collaboration between the United Nations Foundation (UNF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Reproductive Health and Research, including the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), has assisted 26 mHealth projects in the process of scaling up by providing funding, technical assistance and joint learning opportunities between 2011 and 2015. We are grateful to these pioneers in the mHealth field for sharing their experiences and expertise.</translate></p>
