<p><translate>Another key feature of scalable technology is the extent to which various components are able to accommodate changes and improvements in response to needs that emerge during the scale-up process. The <b><em>adaptability of technology</em></b> involves changes in the usage of the product across different types of users and/or different health domains. This capacity to adapt to new health system needs requires processes to be defined and documentation to be in place for local developers.</translate></p>

<p><translate>The <b><em>adaptability of content</em></b> responds to the need to align an mHealth product with new sociocultural contexts, or to translate the content into new languages. Content adaptability is also important for products whose target population includes illiterate users, since information will need to be available via multimedia or interactive voice response (IVR). <b><em>Transferability</em></b> is a related concept that describes the capacity of an mHealth product to function across different types of mobile devices and operating systems. Ensuring hardware and system compatibility with technologies that are adaptable to a variety of needs will greatly facilitate the scaling up and sustainability of an mHealth product in new settings.</translate></p>
