Constraints take the form of failures in availability, cost, efficiency, quality, utilization, information and/or acceptability that impede optimal provision of specific health interventions.</translate></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><translate>Project teams should begin by specifying the basic foundational elements that will guide the scaling-up process, which includes setting goals and defining the endgame for the mHealth product. To outline the mHealth product goals for scaling up, project teams should articulate the health outcomes and priorities (e.g. reduce stock-outs of contraceptives, improve coverage of routine immunization among children under 5 years) and the health system constraints (e.g. delays in care, low demand for services) that are being targeted by the mHealth product. Delineating the health system problem areas that are a focus of the mHealth product will strengthen the project’s capacity to articulate “value” and appeal to potential partners and attract financing.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Next, project teams should detail how they wish to measure their goal of scaling up. This involves two steps:</translate></p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li><translate>Define the metrics (e.g. growth, adoption, or expansion of geo-political area, as described in Table 2).</translate></li>\n    <li><translate>Specify the quantifiable target or targets (e.g. 100 000 users or 40 clinics).</translate></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><translate>For the second step, project teams should keep in mind the need to gather adequate data to estimate the denominator for each of their targets. The project team will need to estimate the total potential numbers of health workers, clinics, client beneficiaries, etc., that represent the target population that can be reached (i.e. the eligible population) with the mHealth product, in order to have a complete picture of current and future impact.</translate></p>\n\n<p class="title-table"><translate>Table 2.

The two primary endgames for mHealth are government adoption and commercial adoption.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate><b>Government adoption: </b>The integration of the mHealth product into a regional or national health system to be supported largely by the public sector. With this strategy, the mHealth product is adapted for and integrated into the structure and systems of the ministry of health (MOH) or equivalent institution, and is absorbed into practice as a routine “standard of care”. Here, a proportion of the costs related to technology, training and support are reflected in the MOH operational budget.11 For example, the John Snow, Inc. (JSI) cStock initiative in Malawi is a short messaging service (SMS)-based logistics management and information system (LMIS) for health products. It has been endorsed formally by the Malawi MOH and achieved nationwide coverage in 2014. This initiative reflects a government adoption endgame strategy.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate><b>Commercial adoption:</b> Development of the product to be commercially viable. Here, the mHealth product (as a ready-to-use technology or service with defined functionality) is available to end-users through financing from private partners or payment schemes. An example is Changamka’s Linda Jamii micro health insurance programme for maternal health care, which has been supported through a partnership with Safaricom in Kenya.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate><b>Hybrid models</b> that entail elements of both the public and private sectors also exist. Recent years have seen a growing trend in public–private partnerships, which involve an arrangement between a government entity and a private company, and which result in shared costs while maintaining an orientation towards health system goals.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Pilot mHealth projects will over time need to work to shift from a support model that relies mostly on grant funding functioning independently of ministries of health or the commercial sector financial models, to become mHealth programmes that are guided by their endgames goals.</translate></p>\n'}}]);
