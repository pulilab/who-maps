Champions are characterized by their “passion, persistence and persuasiveness”.</translate></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><translate>Once partnerships have been established, it is critical that project teams establish mechanisms to help sustain the partnership over the long term. One particularly effective strategy includes cultivating <b><em>champions</em></b> in different partner organizations. By advocating for the mHealth product internally, champions will help to increase the commitment of their organizations to its scaling up, and help to maintain momentum when challenges emerge. It is critical that champions are aware of their scope of work during the scaling-up process; this may require the project team to provide training, orientation, clear mandates, support for organizing meetings and/or relevant policy support, as needed.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Another key element that underpins partnership sustainability is the establishment of effective <b><em>governance</em></b> structures. Mechanisms for ensuring an inclusive planning process should be established formally early on; this is likely to involve a representative steering committee or decision-making board, a regular schedule of meetings, and mechanisms for transparency and accountability. The committee or board will help to build trust among key partners, foster a sense of ownership and ideally preclude disagreements or power struggles down the line. Another imperative of good governance involves the documentation of partnership terms. This includes formal collaboration agreements (e.g. a memorandum of understanding or MoU) to define the distribution of roles and responsibilities within a partnership, and contracts for vendor relationships.</translate></p>\n'}}]);
