"The second element of M&amp;E for scaling up mHealth products is "
"<b><em>evaluation research</em></b>, which involves using rigorous and "
"systematic methods to assess the product’s effects. Evaluation research "
"differs from routine monitoring in that it tracks the outcomes of expanded "
"implementation efforts rather than programme processes. The development of "
"appropriate evaluation systems for meeting these goals involves several "
"different activities. First, evaluation research calls for the allocation of "
"significant funding, which will vary based on the study design selected and "
"whether an external evaluator is used. Second, there is the need to ensure "
"that the findings will be relevant for core partners and other stakeholders. "
"Provided that stakeholders, especially government and other investment "
"partners, require rigorous evaluations to facilitate decision-making for "
"supporting mHealth products, project teams must closely assess stakeholders’ "
"evidence priorities and reporting requirements early on."
