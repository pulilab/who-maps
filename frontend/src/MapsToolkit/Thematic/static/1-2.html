    <h6>Stages of Evaluation</h6>
    <p>The four different stages of evaluation for mHealth products answer the following questions:</p>
    <p>
      <b>Functionality</b><br>
      Does the technology work as intended?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Functionality</b><br>
      Does the technology work as intended?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Usability</b><br>
      Can the mHealth product be used effectively by the intended users?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Efficacy</b><br>
      Does the mHealth product demonstrate the intended effect in an ideal or controlled setting?
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Effectiveness</b><br>
      Does the mHealth product demonstrate the intended effect in a non-controlled setting?
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final piece of groundwork involves reviewing the effect of the mHealth product on known health system challenge areas and the effect on health interventions. This will help to identify the extent to which additional evaluation activities are needed. Project teams should be able to demonstrate:</p>

<ul>
  that the mHealth product is aligned with scientifically validated health interventions;
general evidence of the effect of the mHealth product on identifiable problems;
context-specific evidence supporting the appropriateness of the tool for a certain setting (e.g. the content has been adapted and validated for local use).
</ul>
