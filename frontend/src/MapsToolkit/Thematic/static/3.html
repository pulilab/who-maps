  <p>SSustainable financing is fundamental to the capacity of an mHealth project to increase its scale, yet it is often the most difficult part of the process. The considerations and skills involved in developing sustainable financing mechanisms are complex, and require project team members with robust financial skill sets to plan for and execute viable financial models.
