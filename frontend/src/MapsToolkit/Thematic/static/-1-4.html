<p><b>Endgame:</b> A project’s long-term approach to scaling up and sustaining the mHealth product once it has proven the effectiveness of its core strategy and technology.5, 6 An mHealth product may pursue sustainability through the following endgame strategies: government adoption, commercial adoption, or a hybrid of the two.</p>

<p><b>Evaluation research:</b> Assessment of the product’s effects and outcomes, with the emphasis on research protocols that include rigorous methods.</p>

<p><b>Formative research:</b> The use of primarily qualitative research methods to inform the development of effective intervention strategies. Formative research helps programme planners and researchers understand the factors that influence health outcomes, including the traits of target populations, such as their behaviours, attitudes and needs, in order to develop mHealth products that are appropriate to a particular context.</p>

<p><b>Hardware:</b> Any physical device that people are able to touch, such as a mobile handset, tablet, sensor or computer monitor.</p>

<p><b>Health system constraints:</b> The specific challenges and barriers that impede optimal health promotion, prevention and care. Constraints take the form of failures in availability, cost, efficiency, quality, utilization, information and/or acceptability that impede optimal provision of specific health interventions.</p>

<p><b>Implementers:</b> Individuals that are involved in the development and deployment of an mHealth product.</p>

<p><b>Information and communication technology (ICT):</b> The integration of information systems, telecommunications systems, and components of a system related to the capture, storage, retrieval and transmission of data.</p>

<p><b>Interoperability:</b> The ability of different information technology systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data, and use the information that has been exchanged. Interoperability is enabled by the use of common data standards.</p>

<p><b>Latency:</b> The amount of time or delay for data to travel from the source (mobile device) to the data centre. Latency, along with bandwidth, determines the speed of a network connection.</p>

<p><b>mHealth strategy:</b> The application of a technology for a defined health purpose (e.g. text message to deliver messages for antenatal care follow-up) in order to address specific health system challenges.</p>

<p><b>Mobile aggregator:</b> A company that serves as an intermediary between application/content providers and MNOs in order to provide message traffic throughput to multiple MNOs or other aggregators. Mobile aggregators also often rent out virtual numbers and short codes to application/content providers, and may provide mobile initiative campaign oversight, administration and billing services.</p>

<p><b>Mobile health (mHealth):</b> The use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives.</p>

<p><b>Mobile money:</b> A cash management service available on a mobile device or the Internet that facilitates money transfer by allowing customers to convert cash to and from electronic value (“e-money”), and perform transfers or make payments.</p>

<p><b>Mobile network operator (MNO):</b> A telephone company that provides wireless communications services for mobile phone subscribers. An MNO must own or control all of the components necessary to sell and deliver services, such as network infrastructure and radio spectrum allocation.</p>

<p><b>Payers:</b> Payers are entities that are willing and able to pay for or reimburse specific products or services. This differs from a funder, which provides financing to set up or grow programmes. For example, MNOs who subsidize short messaging service (SMS) or text messaging costs can be considered as payers of the mHealth product.</p>

<p><b>Pilot testing:</b> A small-scale study that allows project managers to assess implementation factors such as feasibility, acceptability and cost. For mHealth products, the results of a pilot study are generally used to inform decisions surrounding scaling up.</p>

<p><b>Process monitoring:</b> Routine and ongoing monitoring of the implementation of the product to track programme processes, review implementation milestones, and make course corrections throughout the scaling-up process.</p>

<p><b>Product:</b> In the context of mHealth, this term refers to the combination of technology components, software, and the strategy of their use to address particular challenges related to the health system.</p>

<p><b>Programme fidelity: </b>The degree to which the product is implemented as it was intended.</p>

<p><b>Scaling up:</b> Scaling up consists of deliberate efforts to increase the impact of innovations successfully tested in pilot or experimental projects so as to benefit more people and to foster policy and programme development on a lasting basis.</p>

<p><b>Secondary users:</b> Individuals who derive benefit from end-users’ input into mHealth products, but do not themselves directly enter data (e.g. supervisors).</p>

<p><b>Short messaging service (SMS):</b> SMS allows mobile phone users to directly send and receive personal text messages that can be up to 160 characters long. SMS is supported by all mobile phones, and the messages can be delivered between users of different MNOs.</p>

<p><b>Software:</b> A set of code and instructions that can be installed onto hardware. Examples of software include mobile phone applications, client and server-side platforms, and computer and mobile-device operating systems.</p>

<p><b>Standard operating procedures (SOPs):</b> Written instructions intended to document the steps required for project staff to perform a particular activity.</p>

<p><b>Stress test:</b> An assessment of how well the entire mHealth system functions when tested by extreme conditions (e.g. maximum data requests).</p>

<p><b>Sustainability:</b> A process that enables individuals, communities and organizations to decrease their dependence on insecure resources and maintain the health gains of the intervention beyond the specific/initial project period. For an mHealth product to be sustainable, it must be supported by stable and secure financial and technical resources, as well as enduring partnerships. In addition, sustainability depends on the project’s capacity to continually adapt the product to meet the demands of users and the ever-evolving operational environment.</p>

<p><b>Total cost of ownership (TCO):</b> A financial estimate that accounts for the long-term direct and indirect costs of a product or service. The total cost of an mHealth product will include costs associated with software development, training, implementation, and other related costs for the project as well as for end-users.</p>

<p><b>Value chain analysis:</b> An evaluation of the relationships between relevant stakeholders based on the product’s value proposition (“the promoted utility of the product”) from each stakeholder’s perspective.</p>

<p><b>Value proposition:</b> The promoted utility of the product for a given stakeholder.</p>
