<p><translate>When engaging with strategic partners, the first step involves <b><em>identification of partners</em></b> that have the diversity of expertise and services to complement project needs. Such decisions demand careful reflection on the types of competencies held by the project team itself, and the areas requiring external guidance or resources. Collaborations often involve one or two <b>core partners</b> that are critical to pursuing the chosen endgame strategy. A range of additional strategic partners will fill important roles; examples include local community-based organizations (CBOs) to provide implementation support, and research partners to assist with monitoring and evaluation.24 Additional partners will also include local stakeholders, e.g. community councils or leaders, whose approval is critical to build the credibility needed to scale up the programme.</translate></p>

<p><translate>A central feature of establishing partnerships involves <b><em>fostering buy-in</em></b> for scaling up the mHealth product. This will involve critically assessing each potential partner’s notion of value, and then determining the <b>value proposition</b> of the product for each one. For example, government officials will be more inclined to adopt and integrate an mHealth product that offers efficiency and coverage improvements relative to the status quo approaches, and that addresses priorities in the national health strategy. MNOs may define value as a product that has potential to increase financial revenue through enhancing brand awareness or attracting new customer segments. Project teams must make an effort to link the anticipated outcomes of the mHealth product to the organizational goals of their partners, thereby fostering greater buy-in and paving the way to mutually beneficial collaborations. Table 3 outlines additional examples of partners’ distinct notions of value.</translate></p>
