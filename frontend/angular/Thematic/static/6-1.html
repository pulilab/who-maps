    <h3><translate>Domain 16: Evaluation research</translate></h3>
</div>

<p><translate>The second element of M&amp;E for scaling up mHealth products is <b><em>evaluation research</em></b>, which involves using rigorous and systematic methods to assess the product’s effects. Evaluation research differs from routine monitoring in that it tracks the outcomes of expanded implementation efforts rather than programme processes. The development of appropriate evaluation systems for meeting these goals involves several different activities. First, evaluation research calls for the allocation of significant funding, which will vary based on the study design selected and whether an external evaluator is used. Second, there is the need to ensure that the findings will be relevant for core partners and other stakeholders. Provided that stakeholders, especially government and other investment partners, require rigorous evaluations to facilitate decision-making for supporting mHealth products, project teams must closely assess stakeholders’ evidence priorities and reporting requirements early on.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Third, an evaluation framework (such as a theory of change or a logical framework) must be devopeloped that details the links among the mHealth product inputs, activities, outputs and outcomes or impacts. This evaluation requires quality data streams from both system-generated and human-collected data. The data collection methods need to be aligned with stakeholder priorities and with the evaluation framework. Finally, evaluation preparatory activities involve applying for and securing ethical approval for research activities.</translate></p>

<p><translate>In considering evidence in relation to relevant stakeholders, projects will want to articulate the types of <b><em>evidence claims</em></b> that are needed at various levels of the health system. The mHealth product may affect three areas: (1) the <b>health system</b>; (2) <b>provider/health service delivery</b> performance; and (3) <b>individual health status</b>. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analyses demonstrate value for money and cost-savings of the product over standard care.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Next, for each of the specified outcomes, project teams will need to define key components of the evaluation process, including indicators (e.g. number of monthly antenatal care [ANC] visits), data sources (e.g. DHIS2 reporting records), data collection methods (e.g. household interviews) and comparator groups (e.g. number of monthly ANC visits prior to implementation of the mHealth product).</translate></p>

<p><translate>Finally, project teams should consider opportunities for the <b><em>dissemination</em></b> of their evaluation findings, both in terms of local dissemination (e.g. press briefings) and wider dissemination (e.g. poster sessions at conferences). Once the evaluation results become available, project teams must ensure these are presented in formats that are appropriate and accessible to stakeholders.</translate></p>
