MNOs may define value as a product that has potential to increase financial revenue through enhancing brand awareness or attracting new customer segments.

Axis 1: Groundwork describes three domains that need to be addressed before a project should move through the next axes. These cover: (a) the scaling-up goals and endgame, (b) the contextual environment of the target setting, and (c) the underlying scientific basis for the mHealth product itself. Describing these domains will lay the groundwork for subsequent strategic planning decisions along the entire scaling-up pathway."

Additionally, Toolkit authors facilitated technical workshops and conducted field research at country level, using key informant interviews to explore and understand the different factors affecting the scaling up and sustainability of projects. The network of IWG mHealth project grantees played a fundamental role in informing and validating the Toolkit throughout its development."

msgid "Finally, successful scaling up will call for appropriate contingency planning, or procedures to maintain the continuity of use of the product in the event of infrastructure or programme obstacles. First, procedures must be established to address <b><em>technical constraints</em></b> related to connectivity and electricity (see Axis 1: Groundwork), for users to operate the application during network shortages, power outages or other unforeseen issues. In addition, promoting the <b><em>retention of devices</em></b> requires strategic planning and the adoption of procedures to prevent loss, theft, breakage and the misuse of mobile devices. In many settings, it will be necessary for these procedures to be vetted by the community or other local stakeholders to ensure they are appropriate."

In addition to identifying key payers, projects should identify and engage alternative payers to cover themselves in the event that primary payer partnerships come to an end. In this way, project teams may build contingency plans to increase the likelihood of financial sustainability."

Furthermore, projects should attempt to quantify any in-kind contributions they may receive from other organizations, and identify cost-share opportunities (i.e. differentiating between costs that will be covered by the project team itself and costs that may be covered by other stakeholders). Project teams should also keep in mind that drafting a budget should not be a one-off event. Budgets should be revisited regularly since funding, assumptions and activities can all change.

msgid "Interoperability is being increasingly recognized as a crucial element of large-scale deployments, particularly those that aim for national health system adoption. The capacity of an mHealth product to transmit and receive information from external systems and/or applications will greatly increase the value of the mHealth service and its potential for scalability as an <b><em>integrated system</em></b>. For example, interoperability with the national health management information system (HMIS) allows data collected by an mHealth product to be accessed and used by the MOH, which adds value to the product from the ministry’s perspective. This type of interoperability is a critical approach for integrating with heath system structures."

msgid "Interoperability is gained by an application adhering to data (semantic) and technology standards, which prescribe the representations, definitions and formats for common data, to allow for different components of a system to share information and function together. There are three stages in the pursuit of interoperability: (1) recognizing which <b><em>data standards</em></b> must be adhered to; (2) using those standards in the mHealth product; and (3) demonstrating that the two systems can interoperate. Projects will encounter a number of different data and technology standards as they scale up; some common examples are described in Table 4."

Yet forecasting does not simply involve extracting figures from a budget. Instead, it calls for judicious and creative thinking to address several concerns. These include determining the key cost drivers, which are factors that cause programme, end-user or health system costs to change, such as mobile phone penetration and user demand. In addition, project teams must identify where cost savings could be achieved, and think through the assumptions and corresponding risks that could affect projects. Considerations like these will help project teams construct a more realistic view of the costs of scaling up, and prepare them better to avoid financial setbacks that may emerge over time."

This mechanism, which consists of a collaboration between the United Nations Foundation (UNF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Reproductive Health and Research, including the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP), has assisted 26 mHealth projects in the process of scaling up by providing funding, technical assistance and joint learning opportunities between 2011 and 2015.
