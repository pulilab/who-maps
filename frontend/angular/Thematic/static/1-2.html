    <h6><translate>Stages of Evaluation</translate></h6>
    <p><translate>The four different stages of evaluation for mHealth products answer the following questions:</translate></p>
    <p>
      <b><translate>Functionality</translate></b><br>
      <translate>Does the technology work as intended?</translate>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><translate>Functionality</translate></b><br>
      <translate>Does the technology work as intended?</translate>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><translate>Usability</translate></b><br>
      <translate>Can the mHealth product be used effectively by the intended users?</translate>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><translate>Efficacy</translate></b><br>
      <translate>Does the mHealth product demonstrate the intended effect in an ideal or controlled setting?</translate>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><translate>Effectiveness</translate></b><br>
      <translate>Does the mHealth product demonstrate the intended effect in a non-controlled setting?</translate>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><translate>The final piece of groundwork involves reviewing the effect of the mHealth product on known health system challenge areas and the effect on health interventions. This will help to identify the extent to which additional evaluation activities are needed. Project teams should be able to demonstrate:</translate></p>

<ul>
  <li><translate>that the mHealth product is aligned with scientifically validated health interventions;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>general evidence of the effect of the mHealth product on identifiable problems;</translate></li>
  <li><translate>context-specific evidence supporting the appropriateness of the tool for a certain setting (e.g. the content has been adapted and validated for local use).</translate></li>
</ul>

<p><translate>The mHealth project team should be able to reference the specific scientific basis for the health intervention that is associated with the mHealth strategy. This may include, for example, the validity of the specific information content contained in the mHealth product, or the alignment of the mHealth product with medical guidelines such as a vaccination schedule or family planning methods.</translate></p>

<p><translate>The second element requires consideration of <b><em>existing evidence</em></b> and whether it adequately supports the four <b>stages of evaluation</b> to assess the mHealth productâ€™s <b>functionality</b>, <b>usability</b>, <b>efficacy</b> and <b>effectiveness</b>. The pilot stage of introducing an mHealth product will often demonstrate its functionality, usability and efficacy. Gathering evidence of effectiveness, however, is far more challenging and may not be possible until the product reaches a certain degree of scale.</translate></p>

<p><translate>It is important to note that these stages of evaluation do not refer to gathering evidence on the health intervention itself (e.g. the effect of antenatal care [ANC] visits on reducing the risk of maternal mortality), as it is assumed that such evidence is already in place. As such, mHealth products should be viewed as tools that enhance the delivery of health interventions that are already validated (e.g. providing SMS reminders for ANC visits improves uptake of ANC services).</translate></p>

<p><translate>Demonstrating evidence for the mHealth product also requires support for key components of its strategy, including its content, key activities and operational features (e.g. the timing and frequency of the activities). These elements should be drawn ideally from reliable evidence-based sources. If sufficient evidence supporting the product is lacking, then additional evaluation activities are advised before initiating the scaling-up process.</translate></p>

<p><translate>In addition to the general evidence supporting the mHealth product, local validation of the product in the setting or settings in which it will be scaled up is essential. Evidence of the effectiveness of a product in one location does not guarantee that it will take hold in another area with different sociocultural, geographic and institutional characteristics. Thus, formative research and assessment of the cultural context of the specific setting are needed to ensure the product will be appropriate to the new setting. For example, the product would need to reflect the specific needs as well as workflows and information flows of targeted end-user health workers; and when clients are involved, the product should address cultural beliefs, motivations and barriers to accessing services and following treatment guidelines.</translate></p>
