This differs from a funder, which provides financing to set up or grow programmes. For example, MNOs who subsidize SMS costs can be considered as payers of the mHealth product.</translate></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><translate>The development of a strong financial model is the second step in ensuring the financial health of an mHealth product. This process begins with value chain analysis for relevant stakeholders. A sustainable financial model requires all stakeholders to derive some type of benefit or utility from their investments in order to incentivize the contribution of resources. A value chain analysis is a useful exercise for exploring and documenting the interests of potential payers. The perceived utility of the product, or value proposition, may be financial (e.g. increased revenue) or non-financial (e.g. improved brand recognition, more efficient delivery of services). An understanding of these key interests will help the project teams design a sustainable financial model within which all stakeholders believe that the benefits they get from contributing to scaling up outweigh the benefits they could get by investing resources elsewhere.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Next, project teams must develop a comprehensive business plan to guide project operations. In addition to articulating the value proposition, key components of an effective mHealth business plan include a goals statement, a resource mobilization plan, a marketing plan and a product improvement strategy. Just like the budget, the business plan should be a dynamic document that is revisited regularly and modified as the funding situation, policy context and other parameters change over time. A clear business plan will not only help to attract long-term financing partners from the public and private sectors, but will also serve as an internal management and planning tool to keep the project on track to meet its targets for scaling up.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Finally, to ensure the sustainability of funding, project teams will be required to seek out and secure different types of funders and payers (e.g. end-users, grants, government support, private sector support or public–private partnerships) to reduce over-reliance on a single payer. In addition to identifying key payers, projects should identify and engage alternative payers to cover themselves in the event that primary payer partnerships come to an end. In this way, project teams may build contingency plans to increase the likelihood of financial sustainability.</translate></p>\n'}}]);
