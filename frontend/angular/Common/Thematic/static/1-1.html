<p><translate>The second step of scaling up involves conducting a thorough assessment of the contextual elements that may facilitate or impede implementation in the areas in which scaling up will occur. Commonly referred to as the <b>enabling environment</b>, policy frameworks are the: (1) regulations surrounding country health priorities and (2) national health information systems (HIS) and information and communication technology (ICT), including eHealth/mHealth. An understanding of the <b><em>policy environment</em></b> will help project teams identify how their product may fit in and gain traction, particularly among public sector partners.</translate></p>

<p><translate>The <b><em>technical environment</em></b> shapes an mHealth project’s prospects of being scaled up. Assessment of network coverage and electricity throughout the areas in which scaling up will occur, in terms of both reach and reliability, will have fundamental implications for the operational procedures required throughout the process of scaling up – impacting the fidelity of the product in real-world use. Project teams should consider how potential infrastructural constraints may complicate the wider use of the product, and determine strategies to overcome such challenges.</translate></p>

<p><translate>Lastly, project teams should assess the <b><em>mHealth landscape</em></b> in the targeted regions by investigating other deployed mHealth products, reviewing their target market, functionality and success. Such considerations will help the project team to define the similarities, differences and potential advantages of their own compared with other local projects, thus paving the way for strategic planning and alignments.</translate></p>
