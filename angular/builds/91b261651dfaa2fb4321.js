The capacity of an mHealth product to transmit and receive information from external systems and/or applications will greatly increase the value of the mHealth service and its potential for scalability as an <b><em>integrated system</em></b>. For example, interoperability with the national health management information system (HMIS) allows data collected by an mHealth product to be accessed and used by the MOH, which adds value to the product from the ministry’s perspective. This type of interoperability is a critical approach for integrating with heath system structures.</translate></p>\n\n<p><translate>Interoperability is gained by an application adhering to data (semantic) and technology standards, which prescribe the representations, definitions and formats for common data, to allow for different components of a system to share information and function together. There are three stages in the pursuit of interoperability: (1) recognizing which <b><em>data standards</em></b> must be adhered to; (2) using those standards in the mHealth product; and (3) demonstrating that the two systems can interoperate. Projects will encounter a number of different data and technology standards as they scale up; some common examples are described in Table 4.</translate></p>\n\n<p class="title-table"><translate>Table 4: Data standards</translate></p>\n\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t  <th><translate>TYPE OF STANDARD</translate></th>\n\t\t  <th><translate>DESCRIPTION</translate></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t  <tr>\n\t    <td><translate>HL7 (Health Level 7)</translate></td>\n\t    <td><translate>Interoperability standards that facilitate the exchange of health data, particularly clinical data</translate></td>\n\t  </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><translate>CD-10 (International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems)</translate></td>\n      <td><translate>A medical classification list published by WHO and used worldwide as a diagnostic tool and for epidemiologic and health management purposes</translate></td>\n\t  </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><translate>SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomeclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms)</translate></td>\n      <td><translate>A comprehensive collection of clinical terms that provides the basic terminology for electronic health records</translate></td>\n\t  </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><translate>INN (International Nonproprietary Name)</translate></td>\n      <td><translate>A set of generic names designated by WHO to identify pharmaceutical substances and ingredients</translate></td>\n\t  </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><translate>ISO (International Organization for Standardization)</translate></td>\n      <td><translate>An independent entity that publishes worldwide industry standards, including classifications of technology and medical devices</translate></td>\n\t  </tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n'}}]);
