    <h3>Domain 9: Interoperability</h3>
</div>

<blockquote>
    <h6>INTEROPERABILITY</h6>
    <p>The ability of different information technology systems and software applications to communicate, exchange data and use the information that has been exchanged. Interoperability is enabled by the use of common data standards.</p>
    <h6>DATA STANDARDS</h6>
    <p>Methods, protocols, terminologies and specifications for the collection, exchange, storage and retrieval of information associated with health-care applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interoperability is being increasingly recognized as a crucial element of large-scale deployments, particularly those that aim for national health system adoption. The capacity of an mHealth product to transmit and receive information from external systems and/or applications will greatly increase the value of the mHealth service and its potential for scalability as an <b><em>integrated system</em></b>. For example, interoperability with the national health management information system (HMIS) allows data collected by an mHealth product to be accessed and used by the MOH, which adds value to the product from the ministry’s perspective. This type of interoperability is a critical approach for integrating with heath system structures.</p>

<p>Interoperability is gained by an application adhering to data (semantic) and technology standards, which prescribe the representations, definitions and formats for common data, to allow for different components of a system to share information and function together. There are three stages in the pursuit of interoperability: (1) recognizing which <b><em>data standards</em></b> must be adhered to; (2) using those standards in the mHealth product; and (3) demonstrating that the two systems can interoperate. Projects will encounter a number of different data and technology standards as they scale up; some common examples are described in Table 4.</p>
